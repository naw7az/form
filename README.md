### General Setup

1. **Fork and clone the project**.

   - If you are fairly new to Github or Git, please checkout the [**official Github Guide!**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

2. **Use your favorite text editor**

   - Personally I use VScode. You are welcome to use any of your preferences!

3. **From the root directory of the project, install dependencies with npm**

4. ```javascript
   cd client      // go to front end 
   npm install    // install dependencies for front end 
   npm start      // start the front end
   ```
5. ```javascript
   cd ..           // back to root directory
   cd server       // go to back end 
   npm install    // install dependencies for backend end 
   npm start    // start the backend end
   ```

6. Play with any of the available scripts given below.
